### Dark theme style for Dolphin Emulator

I'll finish this later, but here's a quick rundown of what you need to do:
- Extract the .zip and open the folder named Lightsout
- Copy the file/s (depending on which style you want)
- Paste the files in documents -> Dolphin Emulator -> Styles
- Restart the emulator If it was open for it to register
- Check "Use user custom theme"
- Select the theme from the new drop-down menu

### That's about it, I'll make it prettier later haha!
