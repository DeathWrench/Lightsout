## Dark Mode for Dolphin Emulator

### What is this Lightsout thing about?
Lightsout is a theme (or should I say style) for Dolphin Emulator that brings eye-pleasing dark mode beauty to the interface, which will make it easier for you to play your favourite Wii/GC games at 5am! Plus, thereÂ´s two different dark modes, depending on your gamerness.

I'll finish this later, but here's a quick rundown of what you need to do:
- Extract the .zip and open the folder named Lightsout
- Copy the file/s (depending on which style you want)
- Paste the files in documents -> Dolphin Emulator -> Styles
- Restart the emulator If it was open for it to register
- Enter the "config" menu and click on the "interface" tab.
- Check "Use user custom theme"
- Select the theme from the new drop-down menu
- 
### Relevant info: <br/>
The download contains two files, a "dark" and a "black" variant, you can add whichever you like to the respective folder (just make sure they're in the correct folder!)

<br/>

### How to install: <br/>
###### (Windows)
Hang tight, this won't take long: <br/>
- Download the code from [my GitHub page](https://github.com/Humanoidear/Lightsout) by clicking Code -> Download ZIP, or by downloading the release.
- Extract the .zip file with any decompression software you got lying around (WinRAR, 7zip, the windows explorer...) and open the folder named Lightsout.
- Copy the file/s (depending on which style you want) located inside it.
- Paste the files in Documents -> Dolphin Emulator -> Styles.
- Restart the emulator if it was open for it to register.

<br/>

###### (Linux)
Unfortunately, custom styles aren't available in the Linux version :(

<br/>

### How to apply: <br/>
###### (Windows, Linux and MacOS)
Here's how you can change the style into your new one: <br/>
- Open Dolphin (because yeah).
- Enter the "config" menu and click on the "interface" tab.
- Check "Use user custom theme".
- Select the fancy new theme from the new drop-down menu!

<br/>

## What's to come:
I'm already pretty proud of the theme, so my main concern is fixing any issues that may come up, aside from maybe adding different color styles, but that should be it!
